# routine-tracker Codebase Guide for Agents

This document provides essential information for AI agents working on the `routine-tracker` repository.

## 1. Project Overview

*   **Type:** React Native mobile application using Expo.
*   **Language:** TypeScript.
*   **Frameworks:** Expo Router, NativeWind (Tailwind CSS), Gluestack UI.
*   **State Management:** Zustand (persisted via AsyncStorage).
*   **Navigation:** Expo Router (file-based routing in `app/`).

## 2. Build, Lint, and Test Commands

### Build & Run
*   **Start Development Server:** `yarn start` (or `npm start`)
*   **Run on Android:** `yarn android`
*   **Run on iOS:** `yarn ios`
*   **Run on Web:** `yarn web`

### Linting & Formatting
*   **Lint Code:** `yarn lint` (Runs `expo lint` with ESLint)
*   **Format Code:** Uses Prettier. Ensure your editor or pre-commit hooks handle formatting, or run `npx prettier --write .` if unsure.

### Testing
*   **Status:** There are currently **NO** automated tests configured in this project.
*   **Action for Agents:**
    *   Since no test harness exists, verify your changes by carefully analyzing the logic and, if possible, simulating the flow mentally.
    *   Do not attempt to run `npm test` or `yarn test` as they will fail or do nothing.
    *   If you are implementing a complex logic, consider proposing the addition of a testing framework (like Jest + React Native Testing Library) to the user.

## 3. Code Style Guidelines

### General
*   **Strictness:** The project uses `strict: true` in `tsconfig.json`. Ensure all types are explicitly defined; avoid `any` unless absolutely necessary.
*   **Functional Components:** Use functional components with hooks for all UI elements.
*   **Imports:**
    *   Use absolute imports with the `@` alias (e.g., `import { Foo } from "@/components/Foo"`).
    *   Group imports: External libraries first, then internal components/services.

### Naming Conventions
*   **Files:** `kebab-case` for general files, `PascalCase` for React components if they are the main export (though standard Expo structure often uses kebab-case for files like `index.tsx`).
    *   *Note:* The current codebase mixes conventions (e.g., `store/candyStore.ts` vs `components/ui/vstack/index.tsx`). Follow the prevailing pattern in the specific directory you are working in.
*   **Components:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `RoutineTask`, `CandyProvider`).
*   **Functions/Hooks:** `camelCase` (e.g., `useColorScheme`, `scheduleNotifications`).
*   **Variables:** `camelCase`.
*   **Interfaces/Types:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `RoutineTask`, `CandyState`).

### Styling (NativeWind + Gluestack)
*   Use **NativeWind** (Tailwind classes) for layout and standard styling.
    *   Example: `<View className="flex-1 bg-white p-4">`
*   Use **Gluestack UI** components for accessible primitives (Box, VStack, Text, Button, etc.).
    *   Example: `import { Box } from "@/components/ui/box";`
    *   Check `gluestack-ui.config.json` and `global.css` for theme configurations.
*   **Design Philosophy:** Follow a **minimalist design system** for all future modifications. Avoid clutter, excessive colors, or complex UI elements unless necessary. Prioritize clean, whitespace-heavy, and simple interfaces.

### State Management (Zustand)
*   Stores are located in `store/`.
*   Use the `create` function from `zustand` and `persist` middleware for data that needs to survive restarts.
*   Define interfaces for State and Actions separately if complex.
    ```typescript
    interface MyState { count: number }
    interface MyActions { increment: () => void }
    // ...
    ```

### Error Handling
*   Use `try/catch` blocks for async operations, especially those involving API calls or `AsyncStorage`.
*   Log errors using the custom logger service: `import log from "@/services/logger";`
*   Avoid `console.log` in production code; use the logger.

## 4. Project Structure

*   `app/`: Expo Router pages. `_layout.tsx` defines the root layout and providers. `(tabs)/` contains tab-based navigation.
*   `components/`: Reusable UI components.
    *   `ui/`: Gluestack UI primitives.
*   `hooks/`: Custom React hooks (e.g., `useColorScheme`).
*   `services/`: Business logic, API calls, logging, notifications.
*   `store/`: Zustand state stores.
*   `constants/`: App-wide constants (colors, layout settings).
*   `assets/`: Images, fonts, and other static files.

## 5. Development Workflow for Agents

1.  **Analyze:** Before making changes, scan the relevant files to understand existing patterns. Use `grep` or `glob` to find usage examples.
2.  **Plan:** Formulate a plan. Since there are no tests, be extra thorough in your logic verification.
3.  **Implement:** Write code that matches the existing style (NativeWind + Gluestack, Zustand, TypeScript).
4.  **Verify:** Run `yarn lint` to catch static analysis errors. Ensure types check out.

## 6. Specific Rules (Cursor/Copilot)

*   **Restricted Directories:** Do **NOT** edit any files in `components/ui/`.
    *   These are standard Gluestack UI components.
    *   If you need to customize a component, wrap it in a new component in `components/` or override styles via props, but do not modify the core files in this directory.
*   *No specific `.cursorrules` or `.github/copilot-instructions.md` found.*
*   Adhere to the general guidelines above.

## 7. Dependencies Note

*   **Expo:** ~53.0.20
*   **React Native:** 0.79.5
*   **React:** 19.0.0
*   **Gluestack UI:** v1
*   **NativeWind:** v4

Always check `package.json` for the exact versions before assuming API availability.
